Once dominant in the North-East and the Midwest, the party's core support now comes from the South and the Mountain West, as well as Catholics and conservative evangelicals across the country.</span> Click to see the party!</p>

        <p>Here's some information for when you're old enough.
        The U.S. system is designed to resist change.  Deadlock is built in the design except in times of overwhelming majority.

        The party platforms are good illustrations of the parties' basic principles and policy priorities.  Pay attention to what they include, do not include, and how they prioritize issues.  Notice health care is much higher in the democratic platforms.  Budget issues are higher in the republican ones.

        We have the phrase "party ticket" because you used to vote for slates of candidates committed to the "platform."  The parties exist to make things easier for you to understand.  A lot of people disparage them, but it's impossible for single individuals to independently govern.  You have to have organizations; these are more important that the individual on most issues.  </p>
